# This config file is a more advanced configuration using filesystem metadata
# and blob storage in migration mode. In migration mode repositories existing on
# the filesystem metadata will continue to be served entirely from the
# filesystem, while newly-created repositories will use the database for
# metadata and the filesystem, under a separate prefix, for blob storage.
