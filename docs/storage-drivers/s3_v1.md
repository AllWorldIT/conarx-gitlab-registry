title: Amazon S3 storage driver version 1
description: Explains how to use the S3 V1 storage driver
keywords: registry, service, driver, images, storage, s3, aws
---

The older implementation of the `storagedriver.StorageDriver` interface which uses [Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for object storage.

## Authentication Methods

The S3 V1 storage driver supports the static credentials and IAM instance roles.
Static credentials are optional if you are using instance roles.
If the registry is running on an EC2 instance and IAM role is set for this instance, credentials will be fetched automatically.

### Static Credentials

This method uses an access key and secret key to authenticate with S3:

| Parameter    | Required | Description                                                              |
|:-------------|:---------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `accesskey`     | yes     | Your AWS Access Key.                                    |
| `secretkey`      | yes     | Your AWS Secret Key.     |
| `sessiontoken` | no*      | A session token used for temporary credentials. It is only required for temporary security credentials retrieved via STS, otherwise an empty string can be passed for this parameter. |

## Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|:----------|:---------|:------------|
| `region` | yes | The AWS region in which your bucket exists. For example, `us-east-1`. |
| `regionendpoint` | no |  Custom endpoint for the S3 API. Can be used to specify an alternative AWS regional endpoint or to connect to S3-compatible storage services like MinIO or Ceph.|
| `bucket` | yes | The bucket to store registry data in. |
| `rootdirectory` | no | The root directory tree in which all registry files are stored. Defaults to an empty string (bucket root). |
| `encrypt` | no | If set to true, the registry stores all data encrypted in S3. A key ID is not specified, KMS will use the default key. Defaults to false. |
| `keyid` | no | Optional KMS key ID to use for encryption (encrypt must be true, or this parameter is ignored). |
| `secure` | no | Indicates whether to use HTTPS instead of HTTP. Defaults to true. |
| `skipverify` | no | Skips TLS verification when the value is true. Defaults to false. |
| `v4auth` | no | Indicates whether the registry uses Version 4 of AWS's authentication. Defaults to true. **IMPORTANT**: Version 2 of the authentication is deprecated and support is planned to be removed in version 18.0 of the container registry. |
| `chunksize` | no | The chunk size used for multipart uploads in bytes. Defaults to 10MiB. |
| `multipartcopychunksize` | no | The chunk size used for part uploads when performing large object copies in bytes. Defaults to 32MiB. |
| `multipartcopymaxconcurrency` | no | The maximum number of concurrent uploads that will be performed when performing a multipart upload. Defaults to 100. |
| `multipartcopythresholdsize` | no | The size threshold at which multipart copy is initiated instead of a single copy operation in bytes. Defaults to 32MiB. |
| `pathstyle` | no | Forces path-style addressing (bucket name included in path of URL). Set to true for storage services that don't support virtual-hosted style addressing. Defaults to false. If `regionendpoint` is set, defaults to true. |
| `maxrequestspersecond` | no | The maximum number of requests to the storage API per second. Defaults to 350. |
| `maxretries` | no | The maximum number of times the driver will retry failed requests. Defaults to 5. |
| `parallelwalk` | no | If true, enables parallel Walk operations. Defaults to false. |
| `loglevel` | no | The log level for S3 API logging. Supports comma-separated values of: `logoff`, `logdebug`, `logdebugwithsigning`, `logdebugwithhttpbody`, `logdebugwithrequestretries`, `logdebugwithrequesterrors`, `logdebugwitheventstreambody`. Note: `logoff` overrides all other levels if included. Using S3 v2 log levels with this driver will print a warning and the values will be ignored. Defaults to `logoff`. |
| `objectacl` | no | The S3 Canned ACL for objects. The default value is "private". If you are using a bucket owned by another AWS account, it is recommended that you set this to `bucket-owner-full-control` so that the bucket owner can access your objects. |
| `objectownership` | no | Indicates whether the S3 storage bucket to be used by the registry disabled access control lists (ACLs). The default value is `false`. This parameter cannot be `true` if the `objectacl` parameter is also set. |

## Storage Class Options

The `storageclass` parameter allows you to configure the storage class used for registry storage. The following options are available:

| Storage Class | Description |
|:--------------|:------------|
| `NONE` | Default storage class for the bucket will be used |
| `STANDARD` | Amazon S3 Standard storage class |
| `REDUCED_REDUNDANCY` | Amazon S3 Reduced Redundancy storage class |

## Signature Version Deprecation Warning

Support for authenticating requests using Amazon S3 Signature Version 2 in the container registry is deprecated in GitLab 17.8 and is planned for removal in 18.0. Use Signature Version 4 instead. This is a breaking change.
