### 3. Update

1. [ ] Version bump in [CNG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/CNG) is automatically done using the internal `release-cli`. An MR should be found open on the [CNG MR page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/CNG/-/merge_requests) after manually triggering the `version-bump:cng` job. If opening this MR manually please give it the title "Update gitlab-org/container-registry [version]".
1. [ ] Version bumps for specific distribution paths:
   - [ ] Version bump in [Omnibus](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab) is automatically done using the internal `release-cli`. An MR should be found open on the [Omnibus MR page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/merge_requests) after manually triggering the `version-bump:omnibus` job (which requires `version-bump:cng` to be triggered first). If opening this MR manually please give it the title "Update gitlab-org/container-registry [version]".
   - [ ] Version bump in [Charts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts) is automatically done using the internal `release-cli`. An MR should be found open on the [Charts MR page](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/charts/-/merge_requests) after manually triggering the `version-bump:charts` job (which requires `version-bump:cng` to be triggered first). If opening this MR manually please give it the title "Update gitlab-org/container-registry [version]".
   - [ ] Version bumps in [K8s Workloads](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com) are automatically done using the internal `release-cli`. There should be three separate MRs, listed below, on the [K8s Workloads MR page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/merge_requests) after manually triggering the `version-bump:k8s` job (which requires `version-bump:cng` to be triggered first). Each environment needs to be deployed and confirmed working in the order listed below, before merging the next MR. If opening this MR manually please give it the title "Bump Container Registry to [version]".
       - [ ] Version bump for Pre-Production and Staging
       - [ ] Version bump for Production Canary
       - [ ] Version bump for Production Main Stage
1. [ ] Version bump for [GDK](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit) is automatically done using the internal `release-cli`. An MR should be found open on the [GDK MR page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/merge_requests) after manually triggering the `version-bump:gdk` job (which requires `version-bump:cng` to be triggered first).

<details>
<summary><b>Instructions</b></summary>

Bump the Container Registry version used in [CNG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/CNG), [Omnibus](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab), [Charts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts) and [K8s Workloads](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com) by manually triggering these on the `release` job.

The CNG image is the pre-requisite for the remaining version bumps which may be merged independently from each other. Only CNG and K8s Workloads version bumps are required for a GitLab.com deployment. The deployment is then completed as documented [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/k8s-workloads/gitlab-com/-/blob/master/DEPLOYMENT.md). Charts and Omnibus version bumps are required for self-managed releases.

Please mark parent tasks as completed once the corresponding merge requests are merged.

Version bump merge requests should appear automatically in the `Related merge requests` section of this issue.

Note: According to the [Distribution Team Merge Request Handling](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/distribution/merge_requests.html#assigning-merge-requests) documentation, we should not assign merge requests to an individual.
