this issue with you roughly every eight weeks; this is useful to track
your progress, and see if there are any changes you need to make to move

## When you're ready to make it official

When reviews have accumulated, you can confidently address the majority of the MR's assigned to you,
and recent reviews consistently fulfill maintainer responsibilities, then you can propose yourself as a new maintainer
for the relevant application.

Remember that even when you are a maintainer, you can still request help from other maintainers if you come across an MR
that you feel is too complex or requires a second opinion.
